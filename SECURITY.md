# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We take the security of OpenCoupon seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately.

### Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories

The best way to report a security vulnerability is through GitHub's Security Advisory feature:

1. Navigate to the [Security Advisories page](https://github.com/EvgeniiKlepilin/open-coupon/security/advisories)
2. Click "New draft security advisory"
3. Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability
4. Submit the advisory

This allows us to discuss the vulnerability privately and work on a fix before public disclosure.

### Alternative Method: Private Email

If you prefer, you can also report vulnerabilities via email. Please check the repository owner's GitHub profile for contact information, or reach out through other private channels.

## What to Include in Your Report

To help us better understand and resolve the issue, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass, etc.)
- **Affected component(s)** (client extension, backend API, specific file/function)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of concept** or example code (if applicable)
- **Impact assessment** - what an attacker could potentially do
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

## Our Commitment

When you report a vulnerability, you can expect:

- **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours
- **Regular updates** on our progress
- **Credit** for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- **Coordination** on public disclosure timing

## Disclosure Policy

- We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the vulnerability before public disclosure
- We will work with you to understand the scope and severity of the issue
- Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
- We will acknowledge your responsible disclosure in the security advisory (unless you wish to remain anonymous)

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The OpenCoupon browser extension (client)
- The OpenCoupon backend API (server)
- Infrastructure and deployment configurations

## Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (please report to the respective maintainers)
- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Issues that require physical access to a user's device

## Security Best Practices for Users

While using OpenCoupon:

- Only install the extension from trusted sources
- Keep your browser and the extension up to date
- Review the extension's permissions before installation
- Report any suspicious behavior immediately

## Questions?

If you have questions about this security policy, please open a general discussion issue (not for vulnerability reports) or reach out through the repository's discussion board.
